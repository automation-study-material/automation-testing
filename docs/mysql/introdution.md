- Data is stored in tables (rows and columns)
- Uses SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Follows a fixed schema and relationships

**Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle  
**Used in:** Banking systems, school management, business applications

---

## 2. NoSQL Database
- Handles unstructured and semi-structured data
- Highly scalable and flexible
- Suitable for big data and real-time applications

**Examples:** MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis  
**Used in:** Social media, big data, cloud applications

---

## 3. Hierarchical Database
- Data stored in a tree-like structure
- Parent-child relationship
- One parent can have multiple children

**Example:** IBM IMS  
**Used in:** Legacy systems

---

## 4. Network Database
- Similar to hierarchical model
- Supports many-to-many relationships
- More flexible than hierarchical databases

**Used in:** Telecommunications and enterprise systems

---

## 5. Object-Oriented Database
- Stores data as objects
- Supports object-oriented concepts like inheritance and encapsulation

**Examples:** ObjectDB  
**Used in:** CAD systems, multimedia applications

---

## 6. Distributed Database
- Data stored across multiple physical locations
- Improves availability and performance

**Used in:** Cloud platforms, global applications

---

## 7. Centralized Database
- Data stored at a single location
- Easy to manage but has a single point of failure

**Used in:** Small organizations

---

## 8. Cloud Database
- Hosted and managed on cloud platforms
- Highly scalable and accessible via the internet

**Examples:** Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL  
**Used in:** Web and mobile applications

---

## 9. Key-Value Database
- Stores data as key-value pairs
- Very fast data retrieval

**Examples:** Redis, DynamoDB  
**Used in:** Caching, session storage

---

## 10. Document Database
- Stores data in document format (JSON/XML)
- Schema-less and flexible

**Examples:** MongoDB, CouchDB  
**Used in:** Content management systems

---

## 11. Graph Database
- Stores data using nodes and edges
- Designed for highly connected data

**Examples:** Neo4j  
**Used in:** Social networks, recommendation systems

---

## 12. Data Warehouse
- Stores historical data for analysis
- Optimized for querying and reporting

**Examples:** Snowflake, Amazon Redshift  
**Used in:** Business intelligence and analytics
